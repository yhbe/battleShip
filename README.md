This repository contains the implementation of the classic game of battleship using JavaScript. The game allows players to place their ships on a game board and take turns firing at their opponent's ships until all ships are sunk.

Testing:
To ensure the quality and reliability of the game, comprehensive test suites have been written to cover all aspects of the game. Jest's testing capabilities have been utilized to simulate different scenarios and edge cases, ensuring that the game works as expected under various conditions. User input validation, game state management and other features have been tested thoroughly, demonstrating a strong commitment to quality assurance. Automated testing has been conducted throughout the development process, showcasing my dedication to producing high-quality, error-free code that provides a seamless user experience.
